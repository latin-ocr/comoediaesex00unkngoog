Os the ‘Hecyra ’ md ‘ Epidienzomenoe' oi Apollodorus we know very
little. ]'.n hie eommentary upon the ‘Pharmio’ Donntue notieee one or

From thie consideration of the point· er resemblance eud differ-

wmpenmn.

We eeu hurdly doubt thet in the time us Tei-enee, und firorn a much
enrlier perind, ne ie nhown in the similar me οἰ Plautus, the werke of
the Greek dumntietn were generally known end popular nt Rome.
There wne no doubt n lnge party nmong the literery public, is indeed
all the litemry rnen were not of thiu cheu, who looked to Greece ee
their mistress in literature ne well ee in philosophy. The tute sor, eud
knowledge of, the Greek originale, m in Terenee’e time ρεπεν-11]

diffused, md many Greek playn were probably well known before they ‚

lud been reprodueed in e Latin form. We heve eeeu in the eece of the
'Phormio' thet thnt puy wne probably fmffiar to the Bonum public
before it wne produced on the Romu Stnge by Terenee (see nota on
Proleg. v. 26); and the neme rm eppem in the constent quotu-lone

we nuy eonclude thet the knowledge οἰ the Greek drame, md more
