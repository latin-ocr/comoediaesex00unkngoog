504 TERENOE AND THE NEW OOMEDY.

‘'hiala, woorffing to Menander, Cham· told the tale of hie adventure in
Τὶιιὶιί house (aee Donatu- on Eun iii 4 l); md probably the
character of Chremes wne eostened by Terence, for we find thaz
Menander mede ³5 the representative of c rongi: countrymm (ree note
on Eun. iii. 1. 1). Thio lanf· dher-tion we muel} nttribube to Terence'n
own teste, if there w nny marked deperture §rom Menander. For
we ahould heve expected that n brand end mugla eheucter, euch as
would be that οἰ e wuntrymnn just come up to town, would have
pleneed tho Roman audiena. The introductivo of Antipho ie more
ate-ibutable to drametic consideratione. It ie notice-blo that Terence
i· peculim-ly free from soliloquia, and what he hu nre short, The
following am ull the inst-neas in hir plays:

Andr-in, Act ι. Scenae 8 eud 4.

Eunuchus, Aet iii. Seene ὃς Aet iv. Scenes l »nd 2.

Heautontimorumenos, Act ii. Soene l; Aet iv. Seene 2.

Adelphi, Act i. Scene 1; Act iii. Scene ὃς Aet iv. eomes 4 and ὃς
Aet v, Scene 4.

Hecyra, Aet ιι Scene 8; Aet iii< Scene 8,

Phormio, Aet i. Scene 13 Act iv. Scene 23 Act v. Scene 4.

Mennnder, following the exnmple οἰ Euripides, pmbnbly indulged in
long soliloquia, chiefly ae prologuee; aud he wne followed in thie
respect far more eloeely by Plautus then by Terence. In the remerkn on
Meineke'e Eiret anment of the ¹ Colax' ο( Menander, 1 have already
obeerved that Terence deputed coneiderebly from the ordinary pudice.
md, ne we nimy conclude from that fragment, from the pufieulnr enm-
ple of Menander, ιιι hir treatment of the character of the Bmggadoeio.

Iu the ⁴ ffirvromnmuvnros‘ we inve lost the help οἰ the com-
mentar] οἰ Donntua; end from his substitute, Eugraphiue, we guin nn
informati-an os valae on the text αι’ Menander. This phy hu a more
oomplicated plot then any of the othen; end we might euily eon-
jeeture that pert uf thie complexity ie due to the introduction by
Terence either of original matter or of the plot os some other play.
But we have not even ι hint upon which to argue, eud Α mere eon-
jectum ie worse thau absolute ignonnce.

In hir commentar-y on the ⁴ Anum ¹ Donatus mention· one or two
triffing denar-turer fmm the original of Memnder. Thur in Menander
it ie n brother of Bostram that ie introduced to protect ber end her
daughter* ln Terence it in Hegio, her lete hnabaad‘s intimate trienni
(Dan. on Adelphi ιιι. 2. 58). The »uther of the lise of Terence
(whether he wne Suetoniu· nr Donntue) informe ue that Varro pre-
ferred the exordium of Terence’e play to that os Meuander'n.
