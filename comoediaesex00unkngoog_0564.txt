Comedy os the Greeks, that, even werra there no elom connexion
between the two, ι oon-iderntion of tho liter-ry position of Temnon
would he inmmplete without nome notice of the Greek authors from

whom he copied. And thia hemmae euentinl, ne n supplement to the y

gener-l muniant-tion of Temnoe'u litem-y position which hu been
