In determining the text of Tei-enee wo have almost aa much
difficulty ns in any chssical author. Tu pass from modern editions,
in which the student is puzzled <u decide which is the ori-
ginal reading, und which the oonjectuse (fot mosa modern edivam
have more or less consistent-ly followed Bentley’n emendations);
even when we come to the oompmtively pure and ancient
text we ure not yet nn certain gmund. The difficulty of Terenoe's
text is that it is too perfect. His plays have been so popular, and
so much in uae aa a text book, that it ie impossible not to suspect
that in many onzes, which we cannot now hope ω discover, the
smooth corrections os schoolmusters and profem have superseded
the native reading of the author. So Ritsehl snyu, ⁴¹ Omnino vix
ullam menam esse fabularum Terentianamm pum in qm non nli-
quid turbatum sit gravius, criticae nrt-is, medicinam efinn post
Bentleii cums expectans “.” And the smne unoertainty extends
even to the oldest manuscript with which we ure noquuinted. A
cni-esu] examinatiuu oi* the whole text of Tei-enee has couvinoed me
of the truth os another remark of Ritmhl: “Num in Terentio tam
aperta plurimis loeis est quam in Plauto run fuit metricis
munus opem in tetingen-‘lis resarcient-lisque versibus oonmmptn,
euque ex antiquiore aetate repetenda quam qun ipse Bembinus liber
scriptus est: longius nutem n Tei-entim integi-inte Bemhinus
quam a Plautina Ambrosianus abest’.'’ 1 will here briefly mm-
tion the materiale which the Editor hu at hand fm- the purpose of
fixing the text of Terence.

The mos*¹ important Manum-ipe is that which goes by the name οἰ
the “ Bmummss’ smm its possessor, Pietro Bembo. It wne correotml
:md illustrate& by Politian. It finally passed into the hands of
Fulvius Ursini, and by him was bequenthed to the vatiam Libmry.
'l'his Mannum-im, with many others of good stnmp, was used by Faism
in his edition os Tei-enoc, wmpleted after hia death by Victor (lm).
