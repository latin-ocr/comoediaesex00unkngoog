xxii INTRODUOTION.

Em landem hio ducit maximam, qnumffli· pluet
Qui vobin universi: et populo phoent,'' bo.
(Adelphi, Prologr 16—19.)

In both of these pes-egee he evidently waiva: the quatiam leaving the
decision of it in tha first mse to the jndgment ot hi· honrem, ondin the
second ene intimting that, even if it were true, it νυ n matter ol*
which he ought to feel prend uther thum uhamed. Terence wne evi-
dently too good e courtier to deny flatly en imputativo which πω to
the eredit of hin liternry friends. They were no douln flnttered by the
suppo-ixion uf their having ιι share iu the compositione ol* Terenoe, md
he did not cere to vindicate hie own orlginnlity nt the expenee even of
their vnnity. A eompliment of thie kind would onst him nothing, ond
would be very nemptoble tn them. Nor pei-hope did he consider Invi-
nine entitled to my explumtion on meh ι point; und w he declinati to
rdmit or to deny the ehu-ge which hed been brought ngeinet him. On
every ground, then, we nny reject thie story which gives to helina or
Afric-nm the credit os the mthorehip os the beet perte ox· the comedim
