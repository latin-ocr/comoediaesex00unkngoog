PREFACE‘

11« writing the following commonui-y on the plays uf Tei-enee, my
chief sim¹ has been to mnintain the utmost brevity consistent with
elmi-mesu and it is pessime that sume readers may wusider me
too brief upcm passages where s good deal of illustration is some-
times given. But for sn editor ω do good sei-vioe, it is necessary,
in my opinion, that he should indicate st least ns much ns he
actually gives iu the way of explanatiom sud 1 have mordingly
endeavoured ω keep wichia bounds the wudsney ω quotation,

“ which is one of the most human, and st the same time mont trou-

ble-dim erton that s commentator cm fau into. In the selemiau
ns quontions my object has been ω bring sorward especially the
idioma of colloquial latin ss remia in Plautus, parts of Cicero, and
msinmlly in the ssi-lior poen. Fur foma os words Plautus and
Lucretius have been my chief authorities. 1 have endeavoured in
this way bomake my book useful ω the student who wishes ω
nequire s knowledge astho early Roman writers, md to dimo-thim
in each ease to the original authorities, as far us they havs besu
preserved w us, for lmgusge md idium. 'I'he general reader will, ⁷
Ι hope, find sufficiant help in the introductory muer which Ι
have prefixed to every phy, and to every soene in esch of the
plays, ns well as in the notes themselves, in which Ι have never
omaciously passed over any thing which wss likely to be mis-
underswod, οι· which had been made the oocssion of difficulty hy
previa-u commentatore.
