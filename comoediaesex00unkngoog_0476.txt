In the character os Phormio Terence eopied from sn origin-l, in
which the stnnding iden of the parasite vves strictly observed. See
notes on Aet ii. Scene 2. We heve seen s very different ides, though

specimen of his elsss, sud shows ssr more readiness and amiability thsn
most os the tribe. Ῑι is not unworthy os remark ιΙιιι thu play is said
