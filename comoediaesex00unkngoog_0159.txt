Thia is the outline of the play, which gives a very lively and amusing
action. But the most admirable feature is the manner in which some os
the subordinate parts are worked out. The bys-phy between Pythias
and Parmeno is adminble. 'l'he character of the Par-uite as drawn in
Act 11. scene ii. is admirable, end striking from its novelty aster the
hackneyed ideal which is presented to us in all the playa os Plautus.
No less admi-able is the Braggndoeio of Aet ΙΙΙ4 scene i„ the features
of the character being the sanie as those ot the Miles Gloriosus os
Plautus, except thet Terence with greater humour nukea Thraso prouder
of hia wit than of his military sxplcits* The scene in which Thraso is
represented as attacking 'l'hnis in her house (Act IV. scene vit) is
highly ridimilons, and reminds one merc strongly than any passage of
Terence οἰ the free humour of Aristophanes. We cannot wonder that
the Eunuchus should have been the most popular· os all Terence'a plays z
