This play is remarkable for a supposed irregularity in its construction,
which haa made it the subject of an animated controversy among advo-

laid at svening, when Menedemus ia jnat finishing his day's work. The
Third Act commences with tha following morning, and in the interval

emption to the general arrangement or Terenoe's playn, is not ι very
