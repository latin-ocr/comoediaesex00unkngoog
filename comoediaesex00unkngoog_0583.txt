os their Intin pupils. A vast mnes ol' Greek literature wns nt the com-
mand os the play-wright. It was generally sdmirerh and a play wel!
written, or, rather, well translated from one ef the Greek plays, was sure
of sneoess. But the point en which 1 wish hers to insist was the extent
ol* that literature, aud the familiarity with it which was possessed by all
ths best Roman writers. We must therefore rememher, in ndjusfing
the obligetious of Terence to any one play of Mennnder, that while he
had before him ss the special object es his imitation some particular
play—say, fer instance, the ‘Andria' or the ⁴Eunuchus,'—hs was uiso
well acqueinted with the whole o! the Menandri-n repertor-y, und
undoubtedly, whether unconsciously er intentionally, availed him-en
nlwsys os his knowledge. So, to take an instanoe froin our own liuen-
ture, Shnkeepesre, in the composition of many cs his pisces, had before
him more uun one „uum whom he pmiffly sonuum md ir in his
case we allow the existenoe ef ιι presiding genius informing the whole,
md working up the old materiels into a new and consistent creation, we
may, without any violence to historicel truth, assume the seme in the
esse of Terence· Onr want of information should lead us to be wide
rather than nari-ow in our conclusion„ aud we may fairly suppose
thot even lud we before us the plays os Menander from which Te-
rence is said more expressly te have copied in his existing comedia, we
should yet find in him much that is not in any single Greek play,
and which, if not original, is to be gsthered from msny ether phys
os the same, or perhaps οἱ other authors. (See un the ‘Adelphi,¹
p. 4⁹7.) Tlie number of fragments of unasoertained plays os Mc-
nander which fit ruore or· less closely with Terence, many of them
quite as we'll as those passages which are directly quoted from the
correspondiug plays ef Menander, leads us to the conclusion that
Terence drew, not enly from the single play which ha had before him,
hut also from his general knowledge ef the works el* Menander, and es
the other authors uf Greek Cemedy with which he wae familiar.

These consider-atinus are important ic we would estimate rightly the
genius οῖ Terence. In languags he was dcubtless original. His diction
bears with it the mark σί· a refinement and a pelished idiorn which is not
found in other Roman writers os that period, aud which is far superior
to the style ol' Plautus The characters and situations of his drama
were no doubt the usual characters und situations of the New Comedy.
Of these enough has been said' ιιι tha Introduction. But his manner os
treatment must have been his own. And if this* ιιι true ef his language,
we must demand a more accurate wqunintanee with the plots os the
plsys of Menander before we refu-e to allow Terence originality' m the
genernl subject of his comedies. The discrepancies which have been
already notit-‚ed must be taken, as ihr as they go, for· a prool‘ of this
