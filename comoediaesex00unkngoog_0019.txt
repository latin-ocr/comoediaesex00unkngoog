have tiu-own my remarks into s shape of my own, tha scholar win
see that Ι have not sought ω disguise my obligations ω these and
other writers on Latin Versifioetion. 'nie whole subject has been
much neglectech and is so important, perhaps even with a view
ιο the fimus seulement of the text vs Terence, that 1 make no
apology sm· hav-ing entered into it fully.

The Fragments of Menander and other Greek authors have been
stequently notioed in the oourse uf the notes. But fui- the sake of
the studens I have brought (together in an Exeat-sua at the end of
the voiume all the undoubted passages of Menander aud Apollo-
dorus which may be referred to the plays imitated by Tei-enee3
and 1 have at thu same time considered the general question os the
relation of Terence to his Greek predecessom.

At the risk of inurens-ing slightly tha bulk of tha volume Ι have
added an Index oi* the Latinity us Tei-enee, which will, 1 trust, be
considered nn addition to tha usefizlneea of the book. This Index
is based on that in ffiles' edition οἱ Zeune besem spoken os ; but I
found it necessary to make innumemhle nitentium, πωπω, md
additions, so that the Index is to all intents ancl purpose· ι new
one.

I have acknowledged my obligation to other adimi-s wheneverl
have taken from them quotations whiuh were evidently their own.
Every classica] author is, however, sverin-id with a mm os illus-
tnfive mattei- which may be wnsidered the common pmpexty of
commentatum Of all editors of Terence perhaps mont is due in
this way to Westerhovius and Lindenbmg. '1¹0 avoid unne-
cessary lenth I have often referred the render to tho Dietionary of
Antiquities ediwd by Dr. Smith.
